## Project Summary
This project involves the creation of a search algorithm (informed search) in a static environment with obstacles using Python. 
Its objective is to find the shortest path from the start to the end taking into consideration the several different types of obstacles. The environment is a square, grid-like, world which is 100x100.
The algorithm can move to all the nodes next to it, which means it can move to the 8 surrounding grids.

## Environment
These are the different type of nodes that can be made.
